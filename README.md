## Lessons Learned

This project is made using functional component and Hooks is used heavily in this project.
Particularly useState and useEffect and fetch api(fetch from api) and also working with api becomes more handy by making this project

The main problems that i had to overcome is state magament and as Edamam only supports 10 requests per minute i had to ensure that the app does not fetch everytime there's an onChange.
And finally resfreshing the search state everytime the user clicks the "Search" button.
